 @param anObject The object to add to the end of the receiver's content. This value may be nil.

 @brief Replaces the old object with anObject.

 @param oldObject The object to be replaced. If this object isn't contained in the receiver the receiver remains unchanged.
 @param anObject The object with which to replace the object in the receiver. This value must not be nil.
